.TH ALIGN.SEQS 1 2021-12-09 "" "The align.seqs command aligns a user-supplied fasta-formatted candidate sequence file to a user-supplied fasta-formatted template alignment. The general approach is to i) find the closest template for each candidate using kmer searching, blastn, or suffix tree searching; ii) to make a pairwise alignment between the candidate and de-gapped template sequences using the Needleman-Wunsch, Gotoh, or blastn algorithms; and iii) to re-insert gaps to the candidate and template pairwise alignments using the NAST algorithm so that the candidate sequence alignment is compatible with the original template alignment. We provide several alignment databases for 16S and 18S rRNA gene sequences that are compatible with the greengenes or silva alignments; however, custom alignments for any DNA sequence can be used as a template and users are encouraged to share their alignment for others to use. In general the alignment is very fast - we are able to align over 186,000 full-length sequences to the SILVA alignment in less than 3 hrs with a quality as good as the SINA aligner. Furthermore, this rate can be accelerated using multiple processors. While the aligner doesn’t explicitly take into account the secondary structure of the 16S rRNA gene, if the template database is based on the secondary structure, then the resulting alignment will at least be implicitly based on the secondary structure."
